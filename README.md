# protein-design-analysis
A toolkit to analyse complicated de novo protein designs in PyRosetta

> This is WIP. Following interest in a [blog post](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2024/05/pyrosetta-for-rfdiffusion/)
> I am porting my code from various repos to a more general toolkit.

> If you are here because you are collaborating with me, please note that
> currently only [crysalin project](https://github.com/matteoferla/crysalin) is public.

## Still to do

* functional proteinMPNN helper
* Analyses
* Sequence diversity filtering
* Clash analysis
* Abstraction away from RFdiffusion!
* AF2 modelling check
* making references
* misc
